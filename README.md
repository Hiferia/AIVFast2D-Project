# AIVFast2D-Project
This is the demo I created at the end of the first year at "Accademia Italiana Videogiochi".
I used the custom engine "Aiv-Fast2D" and for the audio I used "Aiv-Audio".
The entire project was made with C# on Visual Studio 2019.

The main features are:
- The player moves using the Pathfinding algorithm A* clicking with the left mouse button.
- The enemy moves using the Pathfinding algorithm A* following the player's position.
- The first house's door is locked at the start of the game. To open it, the player must find the key.
- When the player picks up the key the enemy is triggered and starts chasing the player.
- Maps created using Tiled with a Tmx parser.
